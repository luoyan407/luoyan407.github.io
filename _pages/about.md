# About Me
* I'm fortunate to work with Prof. [Mengyu Wang](https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/142596) as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [Harvard Ophthalmology AI Lab](https://ophai.hms.harvard.edu/).
* I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from [University of Minnesota](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/), where I was luckily advised by Prof. [Qi Zhao](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~qzhao/).
<!-- * I'm a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at [University of Minnesota](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/), luckily advised by Prof. [Qi Zhao](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~qzhao/).  -->
<!-- * My research interests lie in the general area of machine learning, particularly in deep learning, reinforcement learning and probabilistic inference, as well as their applications in generative modeling, sequential decision making under uncertainty, multi-task and meta-learning, and multi-agent systems. -->
* I was fortunate to be able to work with Dr. [Yongkang Wong](https://sites.google.com/site/yongkangwong/) and Prof. [Mohan S. Kankanhalli](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~mohan/) at [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/).
* I was excited to work with Prof. [Scott Vrieze](https://cla.umn.edu/about/directory/profile/vrieze) on the [CoTwins](https://genome.psych.umn.edu/index.php/CoTwins) project at University of Minnesota.
* I received my Bachelor’s Degree in [Xi’an University of Science and Technology](https://en.xust.edu.cn/). 

# Research Interests
My research interests lie in the areas of computer vision and machine learning. Particularly, I'm interested in (1) how to improve the generalization and transferability of the learning process when the context varies, e.g., in a continual learning setting, and (2) how to assess the downstream effects of machine intelligence's generalizability, e.g., the trustworthiness of predictions, for the safe and effective use of AI models.
