# About Me
* I'm a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at [University of Minnesota](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/), luckily advised by Prof. [Qi Zhao](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~qzhao/).
<!-- * My research interests lie in the general area of machine learning, particularly in deep learning, reinforcement learning and probabilistic inference, as well as their applications in generative modeling, sequential decision making under uncertainty, multi-task and meta-learning, and multi-agent systems. -->
* I was fortunate to be able to work with Dr. [Yongkang Wong](https://sites.google.com/site/yongkangwong/) and Prof. [Mohan S. Kankanhalli](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~mohan/) at [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/). 
* I received my Bachelor’s Degree in [Xi’an University of Science and Technology](https://en.xust.edu.cn/). 

# Research Interests
My research lies in the areas of computer vision and machine learning. Particularly, I'm interested in (1) how to improve the generalization and transferability of the learning process when the context varies, e.g., in a continual learning setting, and (2) how to assess the downsteam effects of machine intelligence's generalizability, e.g., trustworthiness of predictions, for the safe and effective use of AI models.
